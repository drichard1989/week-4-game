// - First, we need to create all of the variables we think we are going to need. 
// - Then, we need to create all of the functions we think we are going to need. 
// 	-Function for the start of the game, called reset.
// 		-This will do a series of random calculations. 
// 			- First, randomly calculate a randomGoalNumber for the user to try and get to.
// 				- This number must be between 19 and 120, and will be visible.
// 			- Then, the computer will also randomly calclulate random numbers for each of the 4 images. 
// 				- rubyNumber, emeraldNumber, sapphireNumber, topazNumber.
// 					- These numbers must be between 1 and 12, and not be visible.
// 	- Then, we will create a function that will run when an image is clicked.
// 		- When any of the 4 buttons are clicked, they are added together in the yourTotalScore area. 
// 		- The value will be added in the display for yourTotalScore.
// 			- If yourTotalScore is larger than the randomGoalNumber, you lose, game resets, and adds a loss.  
// 			- If yourTotalScore is = to the randomGoalNumber, you win, and reset function runs after adding a win.

// - Then, write your HTML inline? code to plug in the variables on the DOM, and hopefully the thing starts to work!
